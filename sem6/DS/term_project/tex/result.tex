\chapter{Compare}
Now all the algorithms will be compared in two parameters, 
the quality of randomness and the speed with which it is 
generated. The comparison algorithms are given in the appendix.

\section{Quality of Randomness}
The quality of randomness can be checked in many ways, but in 
this report, the randomness is checked by using the blocking 
test.
\\\\
In this, we use the fact that sum of independant variables 
asymptotically approaches normal distribution. Therefore, 
the amount of deviation from normal distribution is the 
measure of randomness.

\section{Results}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{||c c c c||} 
    \hline
    Algorithm & Mean & Variance & Time \\ [0.5ex] 
    \hline\hline
    Leapfrog & 11.42 & 9.90 & 0.81\\ 
    \hline
    Random Tree & 10.86 & 8.90 & 0.88 \\
    \hline
    Modified Leapfrog & 11.33 & 10.40 & 0.84 \\
    \hline
    Sequence Splitting & 9.46 & 6.91 & 0.52 \\
    \hline
   \end{tabular}
   \end{center}

\noindent From these results it is clear that my version 
of these algorithms are not as precise as I would like them to 
be but are close enough to the normal distribution value to 
be considered good enough.
