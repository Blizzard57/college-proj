## Question 1

In this, concurrent mergesort is tested with normal mergesort. From the multiple tests I have run on the code, the result I could draw is that normal mergesort is faster than concurrent one, at least for small sets of data. For larger inputs, the normal mergesort is quite quicker than the concurrent one.
